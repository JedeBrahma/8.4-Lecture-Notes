# Algorithms
    - An algorithm is a set of instructions that can be used to do something. 

# Data Structures
    - A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
    - What data structures are we already familiar with?
    - During this module we will be introducing you to new data stuctures

# Why do we care about algorithms and data structures?
    - Thought excercise
    - Coding interviews are the most common interview types for engineers

# What types of interviews might we encounter in the wild?

# Polya's approach to problem solving
    - You cannot memorize 
    - You can be an expert at problem solving even if you don't solve the problem
    - Step 1: Understand the problem
        - READ READ READ the problem. Read it twice. Read it until you understand!
        - Figure out what the problem asking us for. i.e. how do we satisfy its conditions
            - Look at some test cases
            - Ask clarifying questions
    - Step 2: Make a plan
        - Psuedocode
            - Brief instructions, step by step instructions that we can refer back to that explain how e plan to solve the problem.
        - Sample inputs
            - Once we've solved the problem, we can take our sample inputs and ensure we're getting the expected outcome.
    - Step 3: Execute the plan
        - Start writing some code
        - Talk through the code you're writing/explain your code!
    - Step 4: Look back and reflect
        - Take our sample and go through the code we wrote line by line making sure by the end we're getting the expected output.
        - Refactor our code - clean it up
        - Possible optimizations and time and space complexity
